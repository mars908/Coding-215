                Fire is the result of rapid oxidation of any sort of fuel source, such as gasoline, that explodes outward in a burst of heat and light that creates flames.
            </h2>
            <h4 style="margin: 30px; color: rgb(133, 53, 0);">Flames have always been both a beneficial and harmful thing for humanity. Fire is essential for heating homes and buildings, cooking meats and other parts of meal preperations, and many other things. The light produced from flames was used for centuries as the only way for humans to see in darkness with things like torches and candles. The heat that creating a flame generates also has been a core piece of our lives. As described before, fire has been used for cooking all kinds of food to make things edible or taste better. On the reverse side of this, fire also can be extremely dangerous if it goes out of control. Homes burn down if fire is left unattened or set alight in the wrong place. In addition to builidngs cathing on fire, one of the most devasting natural disaters is  a wildfire. Wildfires can very quickly become so widespread that they can take days or even weeks to get under control by fire departments. Not to mention, the burning or fire also produce CO2, which is also toxic to humans, which makes putting out large fires even more difficult.</h4>
